**Welcome to the project repository! This guide outlines the workflow and best practices for collaborating on the Chwdck project.**

## Workflow Overview:

1. **Main Branch:** Represents the current stable state of the project.

2. **_setup Branch:**
   - This is the primary working branch.
   - All team members branch out from here to work on individual tasks.

3. **Testing Branch:**
   - Used for pull requests and code reviews.
   - Ensures the quality and integrity of the codebase before merging.

4. **Staging Branch:**
   - Final checks and testing occur here.
   - Once approved, changes are merged into the main branch.

## Getting Started:

1. **Checkout to _setup Branch:**
   - git checkout _setup

2. **Folder Structure:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the project's folder structure.
   - Locate your working directory within the src folder.

3. **Create Personal Branch:**
   - Branch out from _setup to create your personal working branch.
   - Use your name as part of the branch name (e.g., `git checkout -b frank_setup`).

4. **Committing Changes:**
   - Stage changes using `git add` and commit them regularly.
   - Avoid pushing directly to _setup branch; instead, push to your personal branch.

5. **Directory Overview:**
   - **pages:** Contains website pages. Organize pages in folders (e.g., `Pages > vendor > Vendor.jsx`).
   - **assets:** Store images, SVGs, videos, and other assets here.
   - **container:** Houses the container component with the shared navbar and footer.
   - **components:** Additional components for pages reside here.
   - **shared:** Includes shared components like the Navbar and Footer.

6. **Finalizing Updates:**
   - After completing the Navbar and Footer, I'll notify the team to make a pull request to update the _setup branch and then update our individual branches accordingly.

7. **Pull Request:**
   - Once your work is complete, initiate a pull request to merge changes into the testing branch.
   - Ensure to incorporate the container component to wrap pages before initiating the pull request.

PS: Notice how I create a folder for my own part, e.g., vendor:
   - `pages > vendor > vendor.js`
   - `components > vendor > Card.js, Button.js, etc.`
   - `assets > vendor > vendor.svg, vendorImage/, etc.`

**By following this workflow, we can maintain a structured and efficient development process for the Chwdck project. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, don't hesitate to reach out to the team for assistance. Happy coding! ðŸš€**
